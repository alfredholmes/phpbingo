			<li>The card is a 4 x 4 arrangement of phrases randomly selected from the ones entered in the enter phrases stage of play. When you hear Grandma, or the person in the title, utter a phrase that is present on your card click it to mark is as said</li>
			<li>If at any point you accidentially click the wrong phrase or simply click by mistake, just click the same cell again and it will be marked as not said</li>
